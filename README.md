# javascript_quiz

## Description

This is a simple quiz app to be used to help the user get some quick refresher questions about JavaScript! 
Once the page loads the quiz begins and the user has two minutes to answer four questions. The four questions are randomized 
each time the user takes the quiz and they are given four different choices for each question. If the user selects the correct answer they are given 10 points, if the user selects the incorrect question the user has 10 seconds subtracted from the timer. If the timer reaches zero before the user completes the quiz, an alert window will appear and say game over!
